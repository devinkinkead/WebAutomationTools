# WebAutomationTools
This Program uses Selenium to automate manual tasks on the Web.

Currently, only 1 feature is implemented: Mass Deleting of Yahoo Emails

To use this, chromedriver will need to be installed. 
On Linux, use the following command:
sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver


The following code is currently designed for linux only:
os.clear('clear')
    browser = webdriver.Chrome('/usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromedriver')


Adaptations for use of this program in other Operating Systems will come in the near future.
